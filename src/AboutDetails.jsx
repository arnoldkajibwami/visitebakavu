                    <article>South Kivu (Swahili: Jimbo la Kivu Kusini; French: Sud-Kivu) is one of 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of
                        the Congo (DRC). Its capital is Bukavu.
                        Situated within the Great Rift Valley, South Kivu is bordered by Lake Kivu, Burundi, and Tanzania to the east;
                        Maniema Province to the west; North Kivu Province to the north; and Tanganyika Province to the south.
                        Covering an extensive area of approximately 65,070 square kilometers (25,120 square miles),
                        it is administratively divided into numerous territories and boasts a population of roughly 5,772,000.</article>

                        The province's topography is an amalgamation of geographical features, comprising mountains, dense forests, cascading waterfalls,
                        and fertile plains. The Rwenzori Mountains, which form part of the Albertine Rift, are located on the province's eastern edge,
                        serving as a vital source of freshwater and sustaining a plethora of flora and fauna. The area boasts an array of wildlife species,
                        including mountain gorillas, chimpanzees, African Forest Elephants, lions, giraffes, and vervet monkeys. Additionally,
                        the region hosts African buffalos, baboons, African clawed frogs, dwarf crocodiles, savannah monitors, Common duikers, and Common agamas.
                        Notably, it serves as a crucial habitat for endangered eastern lowland gorillas. Parenthetically, the region's national parks and nature
                        reserves, such as Kahuzi-Bi√©ga National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve, have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

                        South Kivu is a melting pot of various ethnic groups, including the Shi, Fuliiru, Bembe, Vira, Nyindu, Holoholo,
                        Bwari, Hunde, Nyanga, Amba, Swaga, Shu, and Mbuti. The region is also home to a small fraction of Hutu and Tutsi
                        agro-pastoralists who were transplanted by Belgian colonial authorities in the mid-20th century.
